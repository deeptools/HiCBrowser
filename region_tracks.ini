# This is a minimal example file that can be plotted with the
# chorogenome browser.
# Several types of files can by used and usually they can be
# guess by the file ending. However, sometimes it is required
# to specify the file type to avoid confusions.
#
# The header of each section is not used by the program but
# is useful to add a meaninful name for the readability of the
# file. Also, in case something goes wrong the name of the section
# will be printed.
#
# Apart from the minimal example here, a more extensive list of
# file types can be found at:
